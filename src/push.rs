//! The pull decoder keeps its state on the stack, and cannot return for want
//! of input. This one is its loops unrolled into a state machine, each state a
//! step that reads 32 bits at most, over the same primitives. A step is run on
//! whatever input there is. If that runs out midway, the bit reader reads
//! zeros and says so, as it does for the pull decoder, which guarantees that
//! nothing was output: the step is rolled back, the few bytes it left unread
//! go into the bit buffer, where they fit, and it is taken again when more
//! input comes. All a step changes besides is either part of the state, or
//! written again from scratch when the step is retried.
